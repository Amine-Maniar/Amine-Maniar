## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Amine Maniar, and I'm part of the Laboratory of Innovative Technologies UR3899 in Amiens, France. 
I earned my postgraduate degree in engineering, focusing on the Management of Intelligent Electrical Systems, from the Ecole Nationale SupÃ©rieure d'Arts et MÃ©tiers in Casablanca, Morocco. 
I also completed an MSc in Signal and Telecommunications from the University of Western Brittany, France, through a dual degree program in 2021.

Currently, I'm in my second year as a PhD student at the University of Picardie Jules Verne in France. My research focuses on neural networks and machine learning techniques for time series forecasting.
